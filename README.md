# Text Simplifier
MHacks V 2015

This Text Simplifier is a beta version of a larger idea. The idea is simple-to help improve the global literacy rates, but hard to implement. Half of children not attending school come from conflict-afflected areas. So the problem became not to bring them to education, but bring the education to them. The obstacle is the lack of stability and access to resources. Textbooks and internet dependent programs can be pricey and impossible. 

Our idea is a tool that is a text simplifier. The essential concept is that a child, teen, or adult can type in a subject, chose a level and have access to an article on their level to read. Then once they understand, they can choose a harder level. It is a viable solution to help people practice reading without having capital. The program could be universal, and just distributed on tablets to households. 

However, since MHacks V is just 36 hours, what we have created is a beta version that is accessible to anyone with internet. Our text simplifier is a Chrome extension that edits a page and makes it easier to read by grade level. There is currently only one setting, but the Flesch-Kincaid reading level will be shown to verify the change.
